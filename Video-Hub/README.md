# Video Hub
 "Excited to share my latest project, a web application built with React JS! My App name is Video Hub. This app allows users to easily search and upload their favorite Videos, using an external API to populate the results. I used Chakra UI During development And I deployed this website using Vercel deployment, I faced the challenge of optimizing search performance, which led me to explore different caching techniques. Overall, I'm proud of the user-friendly interface and seamless user experience. Check it out and let me know what you think!  Technologie Used - React.JS, Charka UI (user Interface). Deployment - Vercel Deployment - https://lnkd.in/dnUAqhdn
